# IDP Tutorial: Building a Production-Ready Platform with Crossplane and ArgoCD

Welcome to the Internal Developer Platform (IDP) tutorial. This repository contains a complete, hands-on guide to building a production-ready, multi-cloud platform using Crossplane for infrastructure-as-code and ArgoCD for GitOps delivery.

This project is designed for Senior DevOps Engineers who are already comfortable with Kubernetes and want to master the art of platform engineering.

## Full Documentation

The complete, detailed documentation for this tutorial is generated by MkDocs and can be found in the `/docs` directory. 

**➡️ [Next Section: Repository Management](./docs/repository-management/01-multi-repo-strategy.md)**

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

-   A GitHub account.
-   Access to an Azure, GCP, or Hetzner cloud account (optional, but required for provider-specific exercises).
-   [Nix](https://nixos.org/download.html) and [Devbox](https://www.jetpack.io/devbox/docs/installing-devbox/) installed on your local machine (Linux or macOS).

For detailed setup instructions, please see the **[Getting Started Guide](./docs/getting-started/01-introduction.md)**.

## VS Code Configuration (Important)

This repository contains configuration for the Gemini Code Assist extension in the `.vscode/mcp.json` file. This allows the assistant to have long-term memory about our project.

After you clone this repository, you **must** update the `mcp.json` file to point to the absolute path of the `.memory` directory on your local machine.

1.  Open `.vscode/mcp.json`.
2.  Find the line containing `e:\Dev\idp-tutorial\.memory:/data`.
3.  Replace `e:\Dev\idp-tutorial` with the absolute path to where you have cloned this repository.

**Example:** If you cloned the repository to `/home/user/projects/idp-tutorial`, the new line should be `"-v", "/home/user/projects/idp-tutorial/.memory:/data",`.

## Quick Start: Bootstrapping the Environment

These steps will get your local learning environment up and running. 

### 1. Fork and Clone with the GitHub CLI

This tutorial uses the official GitHub CLI, `gh`, to manage repository operations consistently. Ensure you have authenticated with GitHub by running `gh auth login`.

First, fork and clone this repository to your own GitHub account. This single command will create a fork under your username and clone it to your local machine.

```bash
# Replace <source-org> with the actual source organization or user
gh repo fork <source-org>/idp-tutorial --clone=true
cd idp-tutorial
```

### 2. Activate the Development Environment

This command uses Nix and Devbox to install the exact versions of all the tools required for this tutorial.

```bash
devbox shell
```

### 3. Install Project Tools

Run the `setup-tools` script to install the Crossplane CLI and Python dependencies for MkDocs:

```bash
devbox run setup-tools
```

### 4. Create the Local Kubernetes Cluster

This command creates a local Kubernetes-in-Docker (KinD) cluster that will serve as our platform's control plane.

```bash
kind create cluster --config gitops-bootstrap/kind-cluster/kind-cluster.yaml
```

### 4. Bootstrap ArgoCD

This is the only manual step. These commands install a minimal ArgoCD into the cluster and then immediately configure it to manage itself and all other components from your Git repository.



Then, run the bootstrap commands:

```bash
# Apply the ArgoCD CRDs and initial setup
kubectl apply -f gitops-bootstrap/argocd/install.yaml

# Apply the App of Apps to start the GitOps sync
kubectl apply -f gitops-bootstrap/argocd/app-of-apps.yaml
```

### 5. Access ArgoCD

Your entire platform is now being created via GitOps. You can watch it happen in the ArgoCD UI.

```bash
# Get the initial admin password
kubectl -n argocd get secret argocd-initial-admin-secret -o jsonpath="{.data.password}" | base64 -d; echo

# Port-forward the ArgoCD server
kubectl port-forward svc/argocd-server -n argocd 8080:443
```

You can now log in to `https://localhost:8080` with username `admin` and the password you just retrieved.

## Next Steps

Your environment is now fully bootstrapped. To understand what you've built and how to use your new platform, please proceed to the **[full tutorial documentation](./docs/index.md)**.
